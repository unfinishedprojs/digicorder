## What does this do

Combined with `mjpg-streamer`, you can record any camera throught your mobile phone on a webapp. 

This project is really specific to make it super lightweight for the Raspberry Pi Zero W, which means there will be compromises in quality to keep everything lightweight.

## Features

- Client-side recording & screenshots
- Automatic download 

## Plans

- Better the recording system
- Add some controls for the Raspberry Pi itself
