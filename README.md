# digicorder
Record a video input with a webserver. This project will be used for my multiple digital cameras, with a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

## What does this do

Combined with `mjpg-streamer`, you can record any camera throught your mobile phone on a webapp. 

This project is really specific to make it super lightweight for the Raspberry Pi Zero W, which means there will be compromises in quality to keep everything lightweight.

## Why?

I bought some Camcorders at a flea market, and one takes only MiniDV, which are relatively expensive. A dedicated recording device usually runs for hundreds, but a RPiZW only costs around 10 bucks. Combined with an AV to USB connector, I can plug my CamCorder into my RPiZW and record everything to my hearts content.
